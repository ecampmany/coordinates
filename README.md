# geographic

Set of very simple geographical tools written in bash:

* Transform geographical coordinates from UTM to Latitude/Longitude and viceversa
(Dependencies: GDAL libraries required)

* Calculate geodetic distance between two points defined by latitude and longitude

* Calculate the area of the minimum bounding box parallel to Equator for any irregular polygone in a kml file
